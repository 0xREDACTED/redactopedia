Different programming language implementations use a mixture of [[Preprocessor|preprocessors]], [[Compiler|compilers]], [[Assembler|assemblers]], [[Linker|linkers]] and [[Interpreter|interpreters]]. No language has the **exact** same process as another (with the exception of c and c++). Languages themselves can even have different ways of processing.
