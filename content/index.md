title: Welcome to the redactopedia!

The **redactopedia** is a collection of knowledge, architectural preferences, as well tips and tricks for common pitfalls that I have accumulated and built throughout my software career. It is currently divided into two main sections:
### 🧠 Knowledge 
As the name suggests, the knowledge section contains all (or at least a good chunk) of my software knowledge. It’s currently broken up into the following subcategories (some of which are still empty):

- 🧑🏼‍💻 **Programming** 
  Language/framework-specific patterns, architectures, and pitfalls (e.g., C++ move semantics, Java Spring Boot quirks).

- 🖥️ **Systems Programming** 
  Low-level system design and implementation (OS kernels, compilers, driver development).
  
- 🛠️ **Tools & Platforms** 
  Guides and pitfalls / solutions for both opensource & closed-source tools, platforms, Operating Systems and other software
  
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity**
  Offensive/defensive security, cryptography, reverse-engineering and ethical hacking
  
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence**
  Core concepts (neural networks, ethics) and practical implementations (Python, TensorFlow) with tool integrations
  
- ⛓️ **Blockchain** 
  Foundations (consensus, proof of work) and code (Solidity / Rust smart contracts) with platform-specific guides.
### 📝 Projects
The project section is what I use to document any of my own or other **open source** projects I plan, create or contribute to. I don't include anything on proprietary stuff that I plan to make money on for obvious reasons :P

This mainly contains decision logs on design decisions as well as problems and solutions, often linking back to the Knowledge section where possible
