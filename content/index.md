The **redactopedia** is a collection of knowledge, architectural preferences, as well tips and tricks for common pitfalls that I have accumulated and built throughout my software career. It is currently divided into two main sections:
### üß† Knowledge 

As the name suggests, the knowledge section contains all (or at least a good chunk) of my software knowledge. This is *currently* broken up into the following subcategories:
#### Programming
Contains all things specific to programming languages and many of their respective frameworks. This includes things such as:
- Standard programming paradigms and patterns
- My own preferred way of architecting different projects based on language & framework
- Language-specific ways of doing things
- Common & niche pitfalls that I have encountered as well as their solutions
#### Systems Programming
This is a rather broad term that encompasses different concepts of what makes up a computer system. For example:
- The architecture & design of Operating systems
	- Things like Kernel & user space, drivers, paging etc
- "Language Processors" - How code becomes a running application
	- Compilers, interpreters, etc
#### Tools & Platforms
This folder contains both open & closed source tools and platforms that I have knowledge on. It includes how-to's, explanations and solutions for common pitfalls. Some example subcategories & specific tools & platforms are:
- Containerisation (Docker & Kubernetes)
- Operating Systems
	- Focusing on configuring, using and troubleshooting different OS rather than architecture, design & implementation
- CICD
	- GitLab CI
	- Argo CD
- CLI Tools
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, etc)
- Secret Management
	- Hashicorp Vault
### üõ†Ô∏è Projects

The project section is what I use to document any of my own or other **open source** projects I plan, create or contribute to. I don't include anything on proprietary stuff that I plan to make money on for obvious reasons :P

This mainly contains decision logs on design decisions as well as problems and solutions, often linking back to the Knowledge section where possible
